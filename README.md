# What The Sort

This project was created to help better understand sorting algorithms and work towards mastery of front end tools. This project is still in progress.

## What Is 'What The Sort'?

What The Sort is a sorting algorithm visualizer. I have met many students that struggle with learning certain algorithms till they get a visual understanding of what is happening. That is when I came up with the idea of creating my own simple sorting visualizer that would hopefully help students alike better understand sorting algorithms

## Tools Used
